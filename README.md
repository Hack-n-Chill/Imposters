Your Doctor

A more efficient and cost-friendly way to know the medications of your ailments. We do not aim to replace doctors but work with them
to create a healthier environment. 

At this stage we have no access to a medication dataset so we are working with what we have in our hands. In the future we want to 
collaborate with some hospital which would give all the necessary information required to deploy our application effectively to the public.

We want to deploy a server of our own which will house the training model as well as the datasets in use. The big idea about keeping a
server is that we can update it continously with newer medication and precious feedbacks from our users.

Yes, we do keep the thoughts of our users in consideration and will use the same to update our datasets to keep it relevant and accurate.

We also keep the option of having u keep in touch with the doctor so u can personally have an appointment with them.

Want to know about popular health concerns going around the world now? We got that covered too with our new section which shows you just this.
